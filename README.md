## About project
This is a bird species classification web app using convolutional neural network model to classify images.

The app was developed in React.js using mainly React-Bootstrap for UI.

CNN model was created in Python using TensorFlow library. Then, it was converted into a format suitable for Tensorflow.js, which was used to implement image classification in the app.

Google Firebase was used as backend - realtime database, authentication and cloud storage.

## Dataset
Dataset used to train the model comes from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species> and contains 515 bird species.
